# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I try to write more code on paper instead of relying on pycharm. But it is still difficult for me.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I couldn't immediately react to what method or idea I should use to write the code when I saw the question. The practical questions every week were very difficult, so I had to spend a lot of time on them.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I try to rely on myself as much as possible to write the weekly practical, and spend more time every week thinking about what I should do.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

There is nothing I need to change. The knowledge is getting more and more difficult, and I can only learn it bit by bit and slowly make myself proficient in applying the knowledge I have learned.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

The course progressed a bit fast, and we didn't have enough time to digest the knowledge we learned, so we couldn't apply it proficiently. The practicals every week were also difficult, which made me feel frustrated during the learning process. When I discussed problems with my classmates, I often found that they had the same problems. I hope to be proficient in using Python to lay a foundation for my work after graduation, but the short school system and accelerated progress still made it a bit difficult for me.
