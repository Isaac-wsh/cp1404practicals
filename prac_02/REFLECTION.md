# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

# 80%. I prefer to practice with the professor in the practical class rather than watching long videos on my own. But I still watch some videos before class every week to understand and roughly grasp the learning content of the week.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

# Because my practical class is on Monday, I always watch the video at home on Sunday afternoon, usually for two hours.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

# I will do my best to complete the weekly practicals independently. I will also complete the weekly exercises as early as possible after class.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

# I still rely too much on the IDE to help me write code. I need to develop my ability to write code by hand.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

# When I find that I don't understand something, I should think about it more after class. Watch more videos to clarify the parts I don't understand.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

# I was able to follow the professor's pace in the practical class and do the exercises. I think I did not bad.
